# ZenChess - Anxiety Free Chess ♟️

A Chrome extension designed to remove Elo ratings and other anxiety-inducing numbers from chess.com, allowing you to just play for fun and focus purely on the game! If you can't see the numbers, they don't exist. *Wink wink*.

## Features ✨

ZenChess focuses on an anxiety-free chess experience by hiding statistics across the platform. You can toggle each of these features individually from the extension popup:

- **Homepage Stats**: Hides your Rapid, Blitz, and Bullet ratings on the main dashboard.
- **In-Game Ratings**: Hides both your and your opponent's ratings while you are playing a match.
- **Chat Messages**: Hides the rating predictions (`win +35 / lose -36`) and individual Elo inside the Game Chat window.
- **Profile & History**: Hides Elo references in player profile sidebars and past game history timelines.

## Installation 🚀

Since this extension is not currently published on the Chrome Web Store, you can easily load it locally as an "unpacked" extension:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/art3mes/ZenChess.git
   ```
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click the **Load unpacked** button in the top left corner.
5. Select the folder where you cloned or extracted the repository.
6. The ZenChess extension should now appear in your list of extensions!

## Usage 🛠️

1. **Pin the extension**: Click the puzzle piece icon in your Chrome toolbar and pin the ZenChess icon (the chess piece) for easy access.
2. **Toggle features**: Click the ZenChess icon to open the settings popup. Use the toggles to enable or disable specific features based on your preference.
3. **Refresh**: After making changes to the toggles, simply refresh your chess.com tab to see the updates in effect.

## Privacy & Security 🔒

ZenChess only requires the `storage` permission to save your toggle preferences locally in your Chrome profile. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or game information.
